# terraform-azure

Clone it, choose one flavor (folder), and run!

This repo contains quick samples to deploy Azure resources using Terraform. Make your lab quick and easy.

1. Make sure you are authenticated in Azure by Terraform.
2. Go to any folder you wish.
3. For the Linux VM deployments, make sure you have generated a public key in your client computer.
4. Run it (```terraform init``` / ```terraform plan``` / ```terraform apply```)

You may feed plan/apply with vars instead the default ones, take a look at the options in the associated ```variables.tf``` file.
